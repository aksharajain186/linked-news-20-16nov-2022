        <p>Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday said he did not agree to Rahul Gandhi's opinion on Savarkar.</p>
        <p>Rahul Gandhi's criticism of Savarkar and Uddhav Thackeray's disapproval of it has nothing to do with the Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said on Friday. He said he spoke to Sanjay Raut on the issue and asked him whether this will weaken the alliance that the Congress had entered into with the Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) and the Nationalist Congress Party in 2019 and Sanjay Raut said, 'no'. The row comes as Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra is in Maharashtra â€“ the birthplace of Savarkar. Uddhav Thackeray was invited to the yatra but he did not join while his son, former Maharashtra minister Aaditya Thackeray joined the yatra and walked along with Rahul Gandhi.</p>
        <p>However, speaking to the media on Friday, Sanjay Raut said Congress leaders in Maharashtra won't support Rahul Gandhi's comments on Savarkar. "Coming to Maharashtra and saying things about Savarkar won't be accepted. Congress leaders won't support him. Bharat Jodo Yatra is against dictatorship and issues like unemployment, inflation and Congress is getting support," Sanjay Raut said.</p>
