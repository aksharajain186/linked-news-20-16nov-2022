        <p>A Delhi court on Thursday sent Aaftab Amin Poonawala, who allegedly killed his live-in partner Shraddha Walkar, to five-day police custody and allowed a narco-analysis test on him.</p>
        <p>Poonawala was produced before the Saket Court through video conference at 4pm. The Delhi Police had filed an application requesting the court to produce Poonawala virtually due to his security concerns.</p>
